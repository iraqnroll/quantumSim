### QuantumSim
QuantumSim is a small C library with no external dependencies that allows you to define, operate and measure quantum circuits.

### Features
- Functional qubit data structure in a form of a Bloch sphere.
- N-sized qubit register data structure.
- Various quantum gates to operate the circuit with in respect to a single qubit or specified qubits in the register :
	- Pauli-X/NOT gate
	- Pauli-Y gate
	- Pauli-Z/Phase-flip gate
	- Hadamard gate
	- CNOT gate
 	- SWAP gate
- A few examples on how to use the library, including an implementation of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm for a n-sized input.
